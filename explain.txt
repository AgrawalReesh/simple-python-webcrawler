Description of crawler program:

The crawler.py script queries google on the given user input. It uses a focused crawling strategy by following the top 8 results from google.
The current program is capable of performing the following actions:
1. querying google to fetch top results.
2. crawling n pages from these top results using a focused strategy (priority queue)
3. calculating score based on occurrences of query keywords on the page
4. Outputting logs of urls and a summary
5. downloading crawled pages
6. Normalizing ambiguous urls
7. Avoiding file types like audio, video, etc
8. checking for earlier visits
9. robot exclusion
10. Avoiding password protected pages

Possible bugs and features not yet implemented:
1. Server not responding exception (the program faults for a while)
2. The scoring function is not accurate (not using cosine or BM25)
3. same files on different servers are considered as different files
4. Socket errors
4. Sometimes gives ‘final_page_score’ is not defined error on certain queries
